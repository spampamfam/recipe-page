        >Instructions Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
        salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of
        water or milk for a fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick
        frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. Cook the omelette:
        Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan
        to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface. Add fillings (optional):
        When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in
        the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
        Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one
        edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then
        slide it onto a plate. Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper
        if needed.</field
